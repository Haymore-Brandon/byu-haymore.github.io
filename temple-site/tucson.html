    <p>Cactus plants at the Tucson Arizona Temple site were transplanted to an on-site nursery and reintegrated into the final landscaping.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Angel Moroni Raising</h3>
      <p>The angel Moroni was placed atop the dome of the Tucson Arizona Temple on July 7, 2016.</p>

      <h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony</h3>
      <p>On Saturday, October 17, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, second counselor in the First Presidency, presided at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Tucson Arizona Temple. Services were broadcast live to area meetinghouses in English and in Spanish.</p>

      <h3>Construction Approval</h3>
      <p>In February 2013, a Church project manager submitted preliminary plans to Pima County to propose making Church-owned property in the Catalina Foothills, where East Ina Road curves into Skyline Drive, the site for the Tucson Arizona Temple. The 7-acre site was purchased by the Church in 2010, and a residence to the north was subsequently acquired.</p>

      <p>The documents included surveys and environmental studies plus site and floor plans that used a rendering of a two-story, 34,000-square-foot mission-style building to represent the Tucson Arizona Temple. Plans proposed a 260-space parking lot with large areas of natural desert open space to provide a buffer for the surrounding neighborhood. No rezoning was required for the site, as it is already zoned to allow religious buildings.</p>

      <p>The Shadow Roc Homeowners Association—the neighborhood where the proposed site is located—previously opposed an office development at that location. But association president, Stan Kartchner, himself a member of the Church, responded favorably to the temple plans. He indicated that a temple is "one of the more favorable uses we could imagine" for the property. He expressed his desire for Church representatives to open a dialogue with neighbors as the plans progress.</p>

      <h3>Temple Design</h3>
      <p>The Tucson Arizona Temple was originally designed with a 95-foot steeple, which would have required a special permit. However, plans were altered, and the steeple was replaced with a dome-shaped cupola—reminiscent of the famous dome that crowns Italy's Florence Cathedral—which does comply with Pima County planning and zoning regulations.</p>

      <h3>Temple Site</h3>
      <p>The site for the Tucson Arizona Temple is located in the Catalina Foothills where East Ina Road curves into Skyline Drive.</p>

      <h3>Temple Announcement</h3>
      <p>On October 6, 2012, President Thomas S. Monson announced plans for a temple to be built in Tucson, Arizona—Arizona's second largest city—during his opening remarks of the 182nd Semiannual General Conference. There are approximately 400,000 members of the Church in Arizona.2</p>
